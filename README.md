# OasisInfobyte Iris Classification Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for an iris classification project. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into different species based on their features.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the famous Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Files

- `_OasisInfobyte iris classification .ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook and explore the project:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: `_OasisInfobyte iris classification .ipynb`
