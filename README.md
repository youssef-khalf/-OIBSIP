# OasisInfobyte Iris Classification Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for an iris classification project. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into different species based on their features.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the famous Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Files

- `_OasisInfobyte iris classification .ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook and explore the project:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: `_OasisInfobyte iris classification .ipynb`

Car Price Prediction Project

Overview
Car Price Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the price of used cars based on various features. The project involves training a machine learning model using a dataset containing information about different car models, their features, and historical pricing. This predictive model can be useful for both buyers and sellers in estimating the fair market value of a used car.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded here. It includes information such as the year of manufacture, selling price, present price, driven kilometers, owner details, and more.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

Data Exploration and Analysis: Understanding the dataset, visualizing relationships between variables, and identifying patterns.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the data for training.

Model Training: Building and training machine learning models to predict car prices.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics.

Inference: Using the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.

Libraries Used
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
